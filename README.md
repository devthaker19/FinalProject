# Introduction
This program is an interactive messaging software.  It was implemented using a combination of client- server sockets, multithreading, file I/O, and finally, displayed using JavaFX. After running it, chat window is displayed, where you can chat with the server. Additionally, an About us button is featured which displays information about the app. Once they login, they can begin sending messeges to other users, while also viewing their message history on screen. Additionally, a fun button is featured on the client side, which runs an animation when clicked on it.
